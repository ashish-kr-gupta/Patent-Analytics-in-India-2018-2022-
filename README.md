# Patent Analytics in India (2018–2022)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Indian Patent filings (2018–2022)** using **Power BI**.  
The goal is to extract insights into filing trends, top assignees, technology domains, and yearly growth patterns.  
It demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills relevant for **IP Analyst** roles.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Simulated patent dataset (~20,000 records)
- Files: `indian_patents_2018.csv` to `indian_patents_2022.csv`
- Key Fields:
  - Assignee
  - Technology Field
  - Family Size
  - Claims Count
  - Citations
  - Filing Status (Granted, Pending, Published, Withdrawn)
  - Filing Year

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Power BI** → Data Cleaning, Modeling, Dashboard Creation
- **Excel** (optional) → Pre-cleaning & basic validation

## 🔑 Key Steps
1. Imported 5 yearly CSVs into Power BI.
2. Cleaned duplicates, standardized names, and handled missing values.
3. Created DAX measures:
   - Total Patents
   - Patents by Status
   - Yearly Growth KPI (with 10% target)
   - Top Assignee & Technology Field insights
4. Built interactive dashboard with slicers and KPI cards.
5. Added narrative summaries to auto-generate insights.

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
- **Granted patents** dominated filings (11,029 total).
- **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** led with 1424 patents, ~51% more than Siemens India.
- **Mechanical** field → highest claims count.
- **Electronics** field → highest citations.
- Clear dip in **2021 filings** (pandemic impact), recovery in 2022.

## 📈 KPI Tracking
- Target: 10% YoY increase in patents.
- 2020 met target.
- 2021 fell below target.
- 2022 showed strong recovery.

## 📑 Deliverables
- 📄 [PDF Report](Patent_Analytics_Report.pdf)
- 📝 [Word Report](Patent_Analytics_Report.docx)
- 📊 [PowerPoint Presentation](Patent_Analytics_Presentation.pptx)
- 📈 Power BI Dashboard (screenshots to be added)


## 🎯 Business Value
- Helps **IP Analysts & R&D Teams** track innovation trends.
- Benchmarks top assignees for competitive intelligence.
- Identifies key technology areas driving innovation.
